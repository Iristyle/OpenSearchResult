# Open Search Result Plugin for Sublime Text 2

This plugin creates a command that allows you to open files listed in the search
results of the 'Find in Files' command.

- When run on a line number that matches your search, it opens the file at the
correct line number.

- When run on a file path in the search listing, it opens the file (without any
line number specified).

## Key Binding

- The default key binding is a Vintage command mode key: "g, o".

## Customizing

You can change various things about the plugin by adding user settings:

- 'highlight_file_paths': Set to false to disable highlighting openable paths (the open command will still work)
- 'highlight_file_scope': The scope that will be used to color the outline for
openable paths. See your theme file for examples.
- 'highlight_file_icon': If you want an icon to show up in the gutter next to
openable paths, include a valid icon name as a string (e.g., 'circle', 'dot')
(see Sublime Text 2 API docs for View.add_regions() for valid icon names)
